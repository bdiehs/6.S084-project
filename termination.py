# goal
# have a recursive data type, which is always a list in our case
# the list is used in a function that recursively calls itself
# let A be outer call and B be inner recursive call
# in A, have lst_A, in B, have lst_B
# must check that size(lst_B) < size(lst_A)
# we talked about this this morning...
# options: inside B, we dynamically do some assert that size(lst_B) < size(lst_A) (seems hard and bad)
# better: dynamically asserting stuff isn't really thing because we're just printing printing
# so all asserts happen in the form of chooses
# probably this is in the choose for B (yeah has to be)
# so if B is a recursive call:
    # have a termination measure (like check it)
    # like P && size(lst_B) < size(lst_A) , where P is the old predicate
# we need a way to check if a function is a recursive call
    # should be easy enough
    # if yes, stuff termination measure condition into the choose
# separate things TODO:
    # detect recursive calls. this is done while traversing the AST
    # stuffing termination measure condition into the choose
